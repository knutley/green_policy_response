## Data Storage Information

The RDS files are extremely large, so this OneDrive is being used to store all data and filtered data.

Currently, the `filtered_UK.rds` file can be found in this drive. The next step is to proceed with topic modeling and clustering, which will be handled by Katie and Aarushi.
